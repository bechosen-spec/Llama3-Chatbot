# ðŸ¦™ðŸ’¬ Llama 3 Chatbot with Streamlit

Welcome to the Llama 3 Chatbot application! This project leverages the power of Hugging Face's Llama 3 model to create an interactive chatbot interface using Streamlit.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat:** Engage in a conversation with the Llama 3 model.
- **Customizable System Prompts:** Modify the system prompt to guide the chatbot's responses.
- **Session Management:** Maintains chat history for the session.
- **Clear Chat History:** Easily reset the chat history with a single click.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Llama3-Chatbot.git
    cd Llama3-Chatbot
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up your Hugging Face API token:**

   Replace `"your-huggingface-api-token"` in the `app.py` file with your actual Hugging Face API token. You can obtain the token from your Hugging Face account settings.

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the application in your default web browser.

## Usage

2. **Enter a system prompt** in the sidebar to guide the chatbot's behavior.
3. **Type your messages** in the chat input box and press Enter to send.
4. **View the chatbot's responses** as they appear in the chat window.
5. **Clear the chat history** by clicking the "Clear Chat History" button in the sidebar if needed.

## Project Structure
